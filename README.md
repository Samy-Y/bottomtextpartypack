# The Bottom Text Party Pack.

The Bottom Text Party Pack is all-in-one *fun suite* for people to enjoy stupid games. Built using the most powerful technologies in the world (Flask and Javascript), it symbolises the pinnacle of human development. The suite's games are listed below:

- **Chess Vs. Checkers:** Some people prefer chess over checkers, other prefer checkers over chess, but with this game, we found a way to piss both these groups. You can only play against the AI for now.
- **Morse Code Battle:** Imagine Trackmania but without the cars, nor the tracks, nor the 3D engine, nor the sound effects, and you race to type words the fastest.
- **Universe Pizzeria:** Create your own very custom pizzas and order them from a certain company ;)
- **Internet Argument Simulator:** Some people might go to the Internet to learn something new or have fun, but we have now provided them with a way to argue and fight online!
